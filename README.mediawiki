'''Note''': The code available in this repository has been tested on Linux, should work on Mac OS X (as seen [http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-post-processing/68061-foamtotecplot360-3.html#post412865 here]) and is not intended to be used on Windows. Nonetheless, further adaptations may be put into place when the time comes.

There are two ways of downloading and installing this code:
* [https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360#using-git Using Git]
* [https://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360#using-zip-or-tar Using Zip or Tar]


== Using Git ==
Run the following instructions as normal user:
<ol>
<li>
Assuming you have <tt>git</tt> already installed and a working OpenFOAM installation, run:
<pre>mkdir -p $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
git clone git://github.com/wyldckat/localFoamToTecplot360.git
cd localFoamToTecplot360</pre>
</li>

<li>Now check the list of branches that exist:
<pre>git branch -a</pre>
You should see something like this:
<pre>* master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/of17
  remotes/origin/of20
  remotes/origin/of21
  remotes/origin/of22
  remotes/origin/of23
  remotes/origin/of30
  remotes/origin/of4
  remotes/origin/ofdev
</pre>
The ones that start with <tt>of</tt> indicate for which versions of OpenFOAM this repository is currently working.
</li>

<li>So for example, if you are using OpenFOAM 2.1.1, then ''checkout'' the respective branch:
<pre>git checkout of21</pre>
On the other hand, if are using OpenFOAM 2.4, then you can simply use the <tt>of23</tt> branch.
</li>

<li>Now you can launch the build process:
<pre>./Allwmake</pre>
It will do everything pretty much autonomous, although midway it asks for you to press the ''Enter'' keyboard key when the <tt>libtecio</tt> library is finished unpacking.
</li>

<li>It should end with a line similar to this one:
<pre>-llagrangian -lfiniteVolume -lgenericPatchFields -lmeshTools -L/home/user/OpenFOAM/user-2.1.0/platforms/linux64GccDPOpt/lib -ltecio -lOpenFOAM -ldl   -lm -o /home/user/OpenFOAM/user-2.1.0/platforms/linux64GccDPOpt/bin/foamToTecplot360</pre>
</li>

<li>If all went well, you can now learn how ot use this conversor by running the following command:
<pre>foamToTecplot360 -help</pre>
</li>
</ol>


== Using Zip or Tar ==
Run the following instructions as normal user:
